Sticky Navbar: The navbar should feature the startup logo on the left side and the navigation links on the right side.
Intro Section: This section includes a heading, a paragraph with placeholder text (lorem ipsum), and a button on the left. On the right, there should be an image of Jeff Bezos, which can be exported directly from the Figma file.
Contact Us Section: This part of the website should have custom input fields. When a user clicks on an input field, no blue outline should be visible (Hint: set the outline to none when the input field is focused).
Table Section: Follow the UI design in the Figma file to create a simple table. Additionally, ensure that the table includes a footer created using the 'tfoot' tag.
